Web cache poisoning damages the reliability of an intermediate web cache source. In this attack, an attacker swaps cached content for a random URL with infected content. 

Users of the web cache source may unknowingly use the poisoned content instead of the true and secured content when requesting the required URL through the web cache

An attacker forces the web serverâ€™s cache to flush its actual cache content and sends a specially crafted request to store in the cache.

In this case, all the users of that web server cache will receive malicious content until the servers flush the web cache. 

Web cache poisoning attacks are possible if the web server and application have HTTP response-splitting flaws.
