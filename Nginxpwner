NginxPwner is a Python-based tool designed to identify common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities on Nginx web servers. 

NginxPwner automates the process of checking for security issues, such as misconfigured HTTP methods, improper file permissions, outdated software versions, and insecure default settings.

Using this tool, attackers can quickly gather detailed information on the potential entry points and weaknesses in the Nginx setup, making it easier to launch targeted attacks.
