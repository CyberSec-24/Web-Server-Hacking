-> A website owner creates a robots.txt file to list the files or directories a web crawler should index for providing search results. 

-> Poorly written robots.txt files can cause the complete indexing of website files and directories. 

-> If confidential files and directories are indexed, an attacker may easily obtain information such as passwords, email addresses, hidden links, and membership areas.

-> If the owner of the target website writes the robots.txt file without allowing the indexing of restricted pages for providing search results, 

-> an attacker can still view the robots.txt file of the site to discover restricted files and then view them to gather information
