-> An attacker may be able to perform a directory traversal attack owing to a vulnerability in the code of a web application. 

-> In addition, poorly patched or configured web server software can make the web server vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.

-> The design of web servers limits public access to some extent. 

-> Directory traversal is the exploitation of HTTP through which attackers can access restricted directories and execute commands outside the web server’s root directory by manipulating a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). 

-> In directory traversal attacks, attackers use the dot-dot-slash (../) sequence to access restricted directories outside the web server’s root directory.

-> The attacker usually performs this attack with the help of a browser.

-> A web server is vulnerable to this attack if it accepts input data from a browser without proper validation
