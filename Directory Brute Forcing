When a web server receives a request for a directory, rather than a file, the web server responds to the request in the following ways.
▪ Return Default Resource within the directory The server may return a default resource within the directory, such as index.html.
▪ Return Error:- The server may return an error, such as the HTTP status code 403, indicating that the request is not permitted.
▪ Return listing of directory content
The server may return a listing showing the contents of the directory. A sample directory listing is shown in the screenshot.

Though directory listings do not have significant relevance from a security perspective, they occasionally possess the following vulnerabilities that allow attackers to compromise web applications: 
▪ Improper access controls 
▪ Unintentional access to the web root of servers

In general, after discovering a directory on a web server, an attacker makes a request for that directory and attempts to access the directory listing. 
Attackers also attempt to exploit vulnerable web server software that grants access to directory listings.

Dirhunt is a web crawler optimized for searching and analyzing directories. This tool can find interesting results if the server has the "index of" mode enabled. 
Dirhunt is also useful if the directory listing is not enabled. 
It detects directories with false 404 errors, directories where an empty index file has been created to hide things, and so on
