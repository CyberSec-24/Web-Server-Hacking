Attackers can use tools such as Shodan to gather information about IIS servers, enhancing their ability to perform targeted and efficient attacks

By identifying the version of IIS used, attackers can match known vulnerabilities to a specific version, making it easier to exploit them. 

In addition, information such as open ports, running services, and server configurations can reveal weak points in the security posture of the server.

With a detailed knowledge of the IIS server environment, attackers can plan their attacks to exploit specific weaknesses. 

For example, if the gathered data show that a particular server uses an outdated version of IIS, attackers may deploy exploits targeting vulnerabilities specific to that version

attackers can use tools such as Shodan, which can help them gather the necessary information about IIS servers, thereby significantly enhancing their ability to perform targeted and efficient attacks.
