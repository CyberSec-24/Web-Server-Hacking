Front jacking is a type of web server attack in which an attacker injects or manipulates the front-end components of a web application, such as scripts or HTML elements, to hijack a user interface or user interactions. 

This attack often targets poorly configured Nginx reverse proxy servers in shared hosting environments by combining CRLF injection, HTTP request header injection, and XSS

Attackers exploit flaws in the target reverse proxy configuration, such as improper sanitization of $uri and $document_uri variables, to inject a new host header. 

This hijacks the execution flow of the front-end reverse proxy server and consequently replaces the accessed backend server with an attacker-controlled server. 

This allows attackers to display malicious content, redirect users to fake websites, execute reflected XSS and phishing payloads, and inject harmful scripts

 The attacker creates an HTTP request containing CRLF characters in the URI to inject a malicious host header and sends the request to the vulnerable reverse proxy server.

The vulnerable reverse proxy accepts a request containing the malicious host header injected via the CRLF injection.
