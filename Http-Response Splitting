An HTTP response-splitting attack is a web-based attack in which the attacker tricks the server by injecting new lines into response headers, along with arbitrary code. 

It involves adding header response data into the input field so that the server splits the response into two responses. This type of attack exploits vulnerabilities in input validation. 

Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and Structured Query Language (SQL) injection are examples of this type of attack

The web server, in turn, responds to each request. The attacker can pass malicious data to a vulnerable application, and the application includes the data in an HTTP response header. 

The attacker can control the first response to redirect the user to a malicious website, whereas the web browser will discard other responses

 the attacker sends a response-splitting request to the web server. 

The server splits the response into two and sends the first response to the attacker and the second response to the victim. 

After receiving the response from the web server, the victim requests service by providing credentials.

the attacker requests for the index page. Subsequently, the web server sends the response to the victimâ€™s request to the attacker, and the victim remains uninformed
