The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves a domain name to its corresponding IP address.

A user queries the DNS server with a domain name, and the DNS server responds with the corresponding IP address. 

In DNS server hijacking, an attacker compromises a DNS server and changes its mapping settings to redirect toward a rogue DNS server that would redirect the user’s requests to the attacker’s rogue server.

Consequently, when the user enters a legitimate URL in a browser, the settings will redirect to the attacker’s fake site.

Step 1: Users who desire to resolve a domain name to its corresponding IP address send a DNS query to the primary DNS server specified in its Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP properties.

▪ Steps 2 to 7: If the requested DNS mapping does not exist on the user’s primary DNS server, the server forwards the request to the root server. 
The root server forwards the request to the .com namespace, where the user can find DNS mappings. This process repeats recursively until the DNS mapping is resolved.

▪ Step 8: Ultimately, when the system finds the primary DNS server for the requested DNS mapping, it generates a cache for the IP address in the user’s primary DNS server.
